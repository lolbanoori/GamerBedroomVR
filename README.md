# GamerBedroomVR
This project recreates a real-world inspired gamer-themed bedroom in virtual reality. The scene includes a loft bed, dual desks, custom stairs, shelves, TV area, and various personal touches. All objects are manually placed and scaled to real-world proportions to provide an immersive experience.
